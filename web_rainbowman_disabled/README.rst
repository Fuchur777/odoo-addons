===================
Rainbowman Disabled
===================

This module disables (hides) the Rainbow Man animations.

In the standard Odoo there is already an UI option to set Rainbowman triggers.
F.e. CRM Lead Form View > Activate Odoo Studio > Select Mark Won > Set Parameters. 
But such functionality requires some steps to be done by the user (admin).

This module makes it easy to hide Rainbow Man indefenitly. Regardless of Studio Parameters.


Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

#. No configuration needed. Just install the module.
